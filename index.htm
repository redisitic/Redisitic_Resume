        <p class="title">ABOUT</p>
        <p>I completed my schooling at The Millennium School, Noida, where I learned the basics of
            Python and C++. I learned further of python by experimenting with single board computers
            such as Raspberry pi while also working on simple home automation. I then learned 3D
            packages such as Blender during the lockdown and completed various courses for C# and
            Unity. Currently studying Computer Engineering at KJSCE and a Creative Team Member at
            CSI.
